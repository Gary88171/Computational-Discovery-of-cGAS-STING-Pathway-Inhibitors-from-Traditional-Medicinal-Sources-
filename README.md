Project Introdution:
The cGAS-STING pathway helps the immune system fight infection by detecting and binding foreign DNA. However, this pathway can sometimes be overactive or malfunction and cause autoimmune problems. The cGAS-STING pathway may be involved in a variety of diseases, including rare diseases, age-related diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. Since the cGAS-STING pathway is the primary pathway for activating the immune system, avoiding activation of this pathway may be able to treat autoimmune diseases. Hepatocellular carcinoma, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and inflammation have all been linked to the cGAS-STING pathway.

In traditional medicine, anti-inflammatory herbs have been used for many years. Traditional Chinese medicine uses turmeric, ginger, licorice, astragalus, and ginseng as anti-inflammatory agents. In traditional medicine in other countries, they use chamomile, mint, rosemary, borage and echinacea as anti-inflammatory remedies. These anti-inflammatory herbs may contain bioactive compounds that reduce inflammation in the body.

This project aims to use ChEMBL to find organically active compounds that inhibit activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. ChEMBL is a free library of over 1 million compounds and 5200 protein targets. The data are standardized and carefully selected from scientific publications. Selecting compounds for our targets or pathways, examining structure-activity relationships, predicting properties such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity, and monitoring off-target activities, side effects, or new uses of compounds are all made easier with this tool, Chemistry Molecular Biology Laboratory (ChEMBL).
Method: 
2.1. Disease-associated targets discovery   
The cgas-sting pathway is a significant pathway that is implicated in a number of inflammatory-related disorders, including hepatocellular carcinoma, chronic kidney disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (Yang et al., 2022). Three important databases were searched using keywords to find known targets associated with the pathogenesis (Zhang et al., 2021). Drugbank database (https://www.drugbank.ca/), OMIM (https://omim.org/) (Joanna et al., 2015, p. D789-D798), and GeneCards (https://www.genecards.org) (Stelzer et al., 2011). To minimise false positives, only carefully chosen targets that were closely linked to the illness were included, and repetitive marks were eliminated (Zhang et al., 2021).  
  
Next, Zhang et al. (2021) imported the protein targets associated with diseases and compounds into the UniProt database (https://www.uniprot.org/) to obtain the corresponding gene name, gene ID, and functions. Using the acquired genes, a Venn diagram was created using the following web tool: http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/. The genes that intersected were gathered as potential genes (Zhang et al., 2021).   
   
2.2. Anti-inflammatory herbs molecule  
Choose bioactive compounds connected to the cgas-sting pathway using ChEMBL. More than 1 million compounds, 5200 protein targets, and other drug-like bioactive compounds have binding, functional, and ADMET data available in the open data database ChEMBL (Gaulton et al., 2012, p. D1100–D1107). The primary published literature is regularly mined for data, which are subsequently refined and standardised to optimise their quality and applicability to a broad spectrum of chemical biology and drug discovery research inquiries (Gaulton et al., 2012, p. D1100–D1107).  
  
ChEMBL enables the selection of tool compounds for probing a target or pathway, analysing structure-activity relationships for compound series of interest, detecting possible off-target activities of compounds that may raise safety concerns, elucidating current side effects or proposing new uses for established compounds, evaluating aspects of the human body such as toxicity, excretion, metabolism, distribution, and absorption; or developing predictive models (Gaulton et al., 2012, p. D1100–D1107). To achieve the goals of this study, we applied bioinformatics methods, as described below.  
  
2.3. Protein-protein interaction network     
Building on the candidate genes obtained in the previous objective, the objective is to retrieve interacting genes from the STRING database (http://string-db.org). The STRING database provides information about protein-protein interactions. The retrieved interacting genes will be used to construct a protein-protein interaction network. The network will be visualised using Cytoscape, a software tool for visualising complex networks (Kohi et al., 2011). The important genes were then determined by calculating three topological features: "degree," "betweenness," and "closeness." The number of edges connected to a node is indicated by the "Degree" parameter. The terms "closeness" and "betweenness" refer to the inverse of the number of distances and, respectively, the number of shortest paths between pairs of nodes (Kohi et al., 2011). 
   
   
2.4. Gene Pathway analysis   
   
We performed the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment for our important genes using Metacape, a functional enrichment analysis database. Three primary categories were identified by the GO analysis for gene function classification: biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components. The potential biological pathways involving the important genes were identified by the KEGG analysis (Zhang et al., 2021).

2.5. Construction of the network to explain drug-disease-targets-pathway

A network analysis tool called Cytoscape can help illustrate the connections between drugs, diseases, targets, and pathways. By using nodes and edges, Cytoscape can display the complex interactions among these entities visually (Zhang et al., 2021) 

Target receptor proteins and medications were compared using a molecular docking technique to investigate possible therapeutics for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. For docking analysis, drug target receptor proteins can be gathered from published articles and internet repositories. Three-dimensional (3D) structures of drug candidates and receptor proteins are necessary for molecular docking analogies. The 3D structure of the intended receptor protein was obtained using SWISS-MODEL and the protein database in order to carry out a molecular docking analogy. The drug preparation's 3D structure was obtained via a download from the PubChem database. Using Discovery Studio Visualizer, one can see the target protein's three-dimensional structure and extract co-crystal ligands and water molecules that are attached to the protein (Horaira et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2021).
